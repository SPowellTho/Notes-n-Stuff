# Notes-n-Stuff
A Notepad/Paint Hybrid

#WHY

This program was made as practice for the QT Framework. I was already familiar with C++ but wanted to branch out into GUI coding. I choose to do a notepad/paint hybrid because I regularly use Post-It notes and the idea of having something I can quickly write AND draw in was something I was interested in.

#WHAT

This repository contains all the files that was used to create the program, they are located in the aptly named "Source File" folder. In the "Executable" folder you will find the program itself, feel free to use it.

#HOW

QT Creator was used to make and compile this program. I also used the provided tutorials as a guide.
For help with compiling the project, I recommend reading the documentation: https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-deployment.html 
And watching this video: https://youtu.be/8qozxqSZQEg
